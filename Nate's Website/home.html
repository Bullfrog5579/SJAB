                <p> My goal with SJAB is to make sure Aboriginal youth, and youth with a minority background feel like they have a sapce safe to get help and be able to talk without the fear of jedgemental mindset and a counselor that can relate to them and feel their passion and pain for their herritage and culture. We need to teach the future generations that it is okay to talk about mental health and its okay to be not okay and get the help you need to become okay in the future. At SJAB we turn life mistakes into life lesson because a mistake is a regret we have a life lesson is a mistake that made us change who we are and how we will over come it to not happen again. Knowlege is the power of the universe adn the more knowlege we can give to the youththe better they will succeed in life. </p>
