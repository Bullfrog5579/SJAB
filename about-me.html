    <H4> About me </H4>


        <section>

            <p> My name is Nathaniel Nairn. My Aboriginal given name passed down to me by my late great uncle Amos is Tsukwa. I currently reside on the traditional and unseeded territory of the f the Stó:lō people, the Semá:th First Nation and Mathxwí First Nation. I myself am Nuxalk First Nations from Bella Coola BC. The reason I wanted to become a counsellor for Aboriginal youth is because I am Aboriginal myself and know the struggle of not feeling comfortable or feeling judge by a counselor for having different beliefs and different heritage and I want to be a safe place for the Aboriginal youth can open up and feel like they have a voice and someone that is in the corner and can relate to their feelings and mind sets. Another asset of mine for counselling is that I am not only a book counselor, I myself went through hard times weather it was from a broken home, to being addicted to drugs from injuries, and over coming addictions becoming sober and finding purpose in my life again after hitting rock bottom and loosing it all to addictions. My message for the community is that you are not alone and it is okay to speak up and tell someone your emotions. With how much life I have seen taken to young from mental health and suicides even if I can help one person get out of that dark state and want to live life again will all be worth it. Life is precious and we need to be there to support and lift people up to be the best versions of themselves and help individuals believe in themselves again with purpose. </p>
